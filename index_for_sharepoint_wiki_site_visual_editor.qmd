# Welcome to the Data Science Intranet Site {style="color: #CF4446;"}

This front page provides quick links to our latest interactive data reports. Please select a report below to access data visualisations and insights.

# About this site 

This site serves as a central hub for data science outputs created using *entirely cost-free* [Fully Open-Source Software (FOSS)](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/what-is-open-source/), including [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R programming](https://r-consortium.org/).

The aim is to provide easy access to interactive, regularly updated reports that facilitate informed decision-making, promote transparency, and encourage the use of data-driven insights in everyday practice.

Only the latest version of each report will be stored on this Site. The reports published here should not be saved to create large datasets, as this goes against the [Caldicott principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-caldicott-principles).

## Important notice 

The reports accessible from this site contain *sensitive clinical and operational data*. Please ensure you adhere to Trust policies and information governance requirements when viewing or discussing these reports. Do not distribute content outside approved channels or to unauthorised individuals.
